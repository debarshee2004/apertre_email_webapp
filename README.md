## Overview

This repository contains a React project called "Apertre React Project," which aims to create an Email Web Application named SnapSend. The project is based on a design provided in a Figma file, which can be accessed [here](https://www.figma.com/file/0hCMozlOme5gQibhakvTn3/SnapSend?type=design&node-id=3%3A573&mode=design&t=BtBkNAbYaVuZn1YK-1).

`Note: Since this is a community project, your contributions will go toward an open-source software project rather than someone else's project, allowing you to use pull requests and issues to learn more and contribute more.`

In this project we will be building a full stack Email App named SnapSend using the MERN Stack.
